The appCache Nanny
==================

> Teaches the applicationCache douchebag some manners!

As we all know, the [Application Cache is a Douchbag](http://alistapart.com/article/application-cache-is-a-douchebag).
It's time to teach it some manners – The appCache Nanny for Rescue!

No more manifest attributes on your HTML files. Whether you want to cache
your assets offline or not, when to start ... you are in control™

Have a glance:

```js
// start to check for updates every 30s
appCacheNanny.start()

// optionally, pass intervals in ms
appCacheNanny.start({checkInterval: 10000})

// you can also check for updates at any time
appCacheNanny.check()

// The appCache nanny tells you if there is a new update available
appCacheNanny.hasUpdate()

// She tells you about all relevant applicationCache events
appCacheNanny.on('error', handleError)
appCacheNanny.on('obsolete', handleObsolete)
appCacheNanny.on('noupdate', handleNoupdate)
appCacheNanny.on('downloading', handleDownloading)
appCacheNanny.on('progress', handleProgress)
appCacheNanny.on('cached', handleCached)
appCacheNanny.on('updateready', handleUpdateready)

// plus some extra ones
appCacheNanny.on('init:downloading', handleInitDownloading);
appCacheNanny.on('init:progress', handleInitProgress);
appCacheNanny.on('init:cached', handleInitCached);
appCacheNanny.on('start', handleStart);
appCacheNanny.on('stop', handleStop);
```

Setup
-----

1. Copy `appcache-loader.html` into the root directory of your app,
   so that it's accessible at `/appcache-loader.html`.
2. Create the `manifest.appcache` file and put it in the root directory
   of your app, next to `/appcache-loader.html`. If you use a different
   name, make sure to set it accordingly in `appcache-loader.html`.

Then load the `appache-nanny.js` on your HTML pages.

```html
<script src="appache-nanny.js" async></script>
```

If you use [bower](http://bower.io/), you can install it using:

```
bower install --save appcache-nanny
```

Background
----------

I extracted `appcache-nanny.js` from [minutes.io](https://minutes.io), which is an [Offline First](http://offlinefirst.org/)
web application, anno 2011. It's battle tested by a ton of users, devices, internet environments.

minutes.io checks every 30 seconds if an update is available. And whenever the user navigates
from one view to another, it reloads the page in case there is. As the assets are all cached,
the user cannot tell that his page got just reloaded. It's silent, without any notification,
or a prompt asking the user to reload the page. And it works very well so far.

Demo
----

The appCache Nanny comes with a simple server for testing. Start it using Node:

```js
cd server
node index.js
# optionally pass a custom port number:
# node index.js 1234
```

It will start a local server at http://localhost:8888 (per default).

Each time the `index.html` gets loaded, the background changes. Try by reloading
the page. Then hit the `Check for update` button, you will see a few log meesages
below. If you reload the page again, the color will change one more time (it's the
index.html that just got downloaded in the background). But if you reload again,
it won't change any more. You can now stop the server, you will still be able to
restart the page.

In order to simulate a change in the application, hit the `Bump revision` button
(make sure to start the server again beforehand). If you check for an update again,
you will see that a new version got downloaded, it now says `has update? yes` on top.

Note that every path will show the index.html file, try http://localhost:8888/some/path
for example.


Gotchas
-------

### Unlisted paths get loaded from the server, not from cache (via FALLBACK)

Thanks to the [iframe hack](http://labs.ft.com/category/tutorial/), your HTML pages do
not get added to the list of cached assets locally, and won't get checked for updates
each time. Which is great especially for a Single Page Application with pushState enabled.
But if your app has paths like `/welcome`, `/Dashboard`, `Meeting/123` and your `manifest.appcache`
looks something like

```
CACHE MANIFEST

/
/app.js
/styles.css

FALLBACK:
/ /
```

Beware that opening `http://yourapp.com` will always show the currently cached
version, as it is explicetly listed, while `http://yourapp.com/welcome` and
other paths will load the page from the server, unless the user is offline.

You might have learned that assets that are not listed in the cache manifest
cannot be loaded at all, even when online. But that's not the case if the
loaded HTML page does not have the `manifest` property on the `html` tag.

TODOs / IDEAs
-------------

* on obsolete, remove the iframe, load it again to check if a new *.appcache path
  has been set. If yes, update and trigger `updateready` event, otherwise trigger
  `obsolete` event
